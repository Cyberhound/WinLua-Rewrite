## Implementation

```
All you have to do is include all of these files into your project and include winlua.h
simple as that! :D
```
**Note: WinLua does not come with lua, you will need to include that
in your project as well. Located <a href="https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz">here (direct)</a> or you can use <a href="https://www.lua.org/versions.html">another version</a>. I recommend lua 5.1.5, as it is built with lua 5.1.5**
