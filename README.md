## Implementation

```
All you have to do is include all of these files into your project and include winlua.h
simple as that! :D
```
**Note: WinLua does comes with Lua, you will not need to include that
in your project. You can use <a href="https://www.lua.org/versions.html">another version</a>. I recommend lua 5.1.5, as it is built with lua 5.1.5**

**Note: WinLua does comes with ImGui, you will not need to include that
in your project. You can use <a href="https://https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/">the latest</a>. I recommend the one it has, as it is built with that version, and it may cause errors and some fixing to do if you do use the latest.**
